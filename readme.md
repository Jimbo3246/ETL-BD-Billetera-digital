# Monthly Report Google Apps Script

This is a Google Apps Script project that includes a "Container Bound Script" (a script associated with a container, such as a Google Spreadsheet). The script performs various functions related to data manipulation and reporting in Google Sheets.

## Main Function

### Function copyYapetoBD

This function copies data from the "YAPE" sheet and pastes it into the "BD_YAPE" sheet in the same Google Sheets document. It applies filters and data processing steps to ensure that only the relevant data is transferred.

## How to Use the Project

1. Open the Google Sheets document associated with the script.
2. Click on "Tools" in the menu bar.
3. Select "Script editor" to open the Google Apps Script editor.
